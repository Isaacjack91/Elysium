The State of the Union Adresses in the 20th century reflect the major issues of their time... Most notably, WWII. It is very evident from mid 30's to lat 40's that war was a important topic to be discussed and considered.

This is really quite an *overwhelming* medium. I have a **lot** to learn with this tool!

# Introduction

The United States has long toted the character of savior and safe haven. It has claimed to act as a shield for freedom and democratic principles, foreign and domestic.
How, then, is it's behavior measured? If by its own paradigm, than doesn't it seem to crumble in the face of so many afflicted and margenalized peoples? The 20th
century is a time rife with opportunistic and underhanded policy making in the United States. It is a century that is testimony to an established power base who
demonstrate racist and xenophobic leadership in order to maintain a status quo. From the Columbian Exposition through WWII and beyond.

Here's some sample text, written in Markdown.
In Markdown, any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.

Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Citing your work is important! [^1]
