# The Cost of Freedom and the Struggle for Equality - African American Civil Rights in the 20th Century

---

## Introduction

The United States has long toted the character of savior and safe haven. It has claimed to act as a shield for freedom and democratic principles, foreign and domestic. How, then, is it's behavior measured? If by its own paradigm, than doesn't it seem to crumble in the face of so many afflicted and margenalized peoples? The 20th century is a time rife with opportunistic and underhanded policy making in the United States. It is a century that is testimony to an established power base who demonstrate racist and xenophobic leadership in order to maintain a status quo. From the Columbian Exposition through WWII and the decades following, the treatment of African Americans and their struggle for civil rights in the 20th century are indicative of such fearful leadership in a nation claiming to lead the free world.
